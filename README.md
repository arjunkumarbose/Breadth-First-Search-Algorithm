# Breadth First Search (BFS) Algorithm

A minimal Python implementation of **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** that walks you through the input *one question at a time* in the console.

## Example Usage

```bash
=== Breadth-First Search (BFS) ===
Number of vertices (n): 5
Number of edges (m): 4

Enter each edge as two space-separated vertex IDs (0-based).
  Edge 1/4: 0 1
  Edge 2/4: 0 2
  Edge 3/4: 1 3
  Edge 4/4: 2 4

Start vertex for BFS: 0

BFS visitation order: 0 1 2 3 4
